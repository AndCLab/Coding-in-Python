Name: Andre Labendia 

Motivation:
I want to be able to make projects in the future with using different technologies as well as collaborate with other developers. Hoping to be able to master the skills required for the course. 

University experience:
I was able to attend one semester in full face-to-face mode before the pandemic in the university which thankfully allowed me to experience what it's like to be a freshman in college. I was able to attend the acquaintance party of that year as well as the University days which is a week long celebration of the institution. The best experience above all else is definitely the opening of the semester where I was able to explore the different buildings, school clubs, and campuses.
